The initial purpose of DeleteNewline was simply to remove newlines. However, it has now evolved into a useful utility program that combines regular expressions, global hooks, and keybinds for enhanced convenience. 

You can specify a regular expression and apply it through `Drag + Keybind` in any program, and the final output will be placed on your clipboard.

This app allows you to conveniently apply regular expressions.  
You can use other programs or websites, but the convenience provided by DeleteNewline will be the best.

## Release environment
* OS : Windows(10, 11)
* .NET : 8.0 LTS

Currently, my personal use environment stays in Windows, so there is no plan to support MAC, Linux environment.

## How to Use?
* Copy the text and copy it to the appropriate application window.  
* Copy the text, right-click on the appropriate program window, and then click the Paste button.  
* **Drag the text and press the `Left Alt + F1` button. (It works with any draggable program on your PC.)**

Text with the applied regular expression is located on your 'clipboard'. You can check it by using the `Win + V` key or `Ctrl + V` key. 
Users can conveniently extract the converted string using a combination of regular expressions and keybind options.

Please note that the keybind option may not run in certain programs due to permission issues. In this case run the program with administrator privileges.
