If you paste text with newlines, the text with the newlines deleted is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Introduce
It is often necessary to insert the PDF text into a translator unless the research paper is written in your language.  
Unfortunately, however, PDFs often have newlines, which are not well recognized by translators. Because of this, I often have to delete newline characters one by one. This project was created to reduce this hassle.

## Environment
OS : Windows / x64  
.NET : 6.0 LTS

## How to Use?
* Copy the text and copy it to the appropriate application window.  
* Copy the text, right-click on the appropriate program window, and then click the Paste button.  
* Scroll (drag) the text and press the Alt + F1 button.  

Text with Newline removed is located on your 'clipboard'. You can check it by using the Win + V key or Ctrl + V key.

## Why do you use this way?
Take a research paper as an example, and each paper has a different form.  
there are times when the distinction of Newline is ambiguous. therefore, rather than creating a program that handles all of these processes, I used this method to achieve maximum efficiency in some sections through these simple programs, reducing user fatigue.

## direction of development
I also thought about whether to perform the translation process itself through the app through API Key (Azure, Google) that each user has.  
but on reflection, I thought it was inappropriate for this program to perform so many functions.  
In conclusion, I actually don't know the direction. If you have any good opinions, please feel free to leave your comments.
