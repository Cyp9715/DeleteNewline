If you paste text with newlines, the text with the newlines deleted is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Introduce
It is often necessary to insert the PDF text into a translator unless the research paper is written in your language.  
unfortunately, however, PDFs often have newlines, which are not well recognized by translators.  
because of this, I often have to delete newline characters one by one. This project was created to reduce this hassle.

you can use other programs or websites, but this program is the best for the convenience of the features it provides.

## Development environment
.NET : 6.0 LTS

## How to Use?
* Copy the text and copy it to the appropriate application window.  
* Copy the text, right-click on the appropriate program window, and then click the Paste button.  
* Drag the text and press the **Alt + F1** button.

Text with Newline removed is located on your 'clipboard'. You can check it by using the Win + V key or Ctrl + V key.

## Why develop this way?
In the case of research papers, it was difficult to find a program for all these forms of the PDF itself. For this reason, we have created a program that can support the maximum convenience so that the user can erase the Newline characters.

## direction of development
I thought about whether to perform the translation process itself through the app through the API key (Azure, Google) that each user has But I thought it was inappropriate for this program to perform too many functions.

if you think there is a feature you need, please contribute.
