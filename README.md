If you paste text with newlines, the text with the newlines deleted is automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Introduce
It is often necessary to insert the PDF text into a translator unless the paper is written in your language.  
Unfortunately, however, PDFs often have newlines, which are not well recognized by translators. Because of this, I often have to delete newline characters one by one. This project was created to reduce this hassle.

## Why do you use this way?
Input the text itself into a translator to process it nicely. Take a paper as an example, and each paper has a different form.  
there are times when the distinction of Newline is ambiguous.  
therefore, rather than creating a program that handles all of these processes, I used this method to achieve maximum efficiency in some sections through these simple programs, reducing user fatigue.

## direction of development
I also thought about whether to perform the translation process itself through the app through API Key (Azure, Google) that each user has. but on reflection, I thought it was inappropriate for this program to perform so many functions.  
In conclusion, I actually don't know the direction. If you have any good opinions, please feel free to leave your comments.
